# StressAPI Dashboard Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan outlines the strategy for testing the StressAPI dashboard UI feature. The dashboard provides a user interface for configuring and executing stress tests against FastAPI applications.

## Test Environment
- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Testing Libraries**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Browser Coverage**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari

## Test Categories

### 1. Component Rendering Tests
**Objective**: Verify that all UI components render correctly.

- **Base UI Elements**
  - [ ] Dashboard header and navigation render correctly
  - [ ] FastAPI Base URL input field is displayed
  - [ ] Authentication section is collapsible
  - [ ] Endpoint selection area renders correctly
  - [ ] Test configuration options are displayed
  - [ ] Start test button is visible

### 2. User Interaction Tests
**Objective**: Verify that user interactions work as expected.

- **Authentication Configuration**
  - [ ] Authentication section expands/collapses when toggled
  - [ ] JSON validation provides appropriate feedback
  - [ ] Radio button selection for auth type works correctly

- **Endpoint Management**
  - [ ] Endpoint fetching works when base URL is provided
  - [ ] Endpoint filtering displays matching results
  - [ ] Select All / Clear Selection functions work correctly
  - [ ] Individual endpoint selection toggles correctly

- **Test Configuration**
  - [ ] Concurrent request slider updates the displayed value
  - [ ] Distribution mode selection changes when clicked
  - [ ] Visual indicators reflect the selected options

### 3. State Management Tests
**Objective**: Verify that component state is managed correctly.

- [ ] Base URL updates when input changes
- [ ] Authentication JSON state updates correctly
- [ ] Endpoint list updates when fetched
- [ ] Selected endpoints state updates on selection/deselection
- [ ] Test configuration state updates with user selections

### 4. Form Validation Tests
**Objective**: Verify that form validation works correctly.

- [ ] Test cannot start without a base URL
- [ ] Test cannot start without selected endpoints
- [ ] Authentication JSON validation works correctly
- [ ] Appropriate error messages are displayed

### 5. API Integration Tests
**Objective**: Verify integration with backend APIs.

- [ ] Endpoints are correctly fetched from the API
- [ ] Authentication is correctly passed to API calls
- [ ] Stress test is initiated with correct parameters
- [ ] Test metrics are displayed correctly

### 6. Responsive Design Tests
**Objective**: Verify that the UI works on different screen sizes.

- [ ] Dashboard displays correctly on desktop
- [ ] Dashboard adapts to tablet view
- [ ] Dashboard is usable on mobile devices

## Test Scenarios

### Basic Flow
1. User enters a FastAPI base URL
2. User configures authentication if needed
3. User fetches available endpoints
4. User selects endpoints to test
5. User configures test parameters (concurrency, distribution)
6. User starts the test
7. Test metrics are displayed

### Error Handling
1. User attempts to start test without a base URL
2. User attempts to start test without selecting endpoints
3. User enters invalid JSON in authentication field
4. API fails to fetch endpoints

## Automated Testing Implementation
The automated tests are implemented in `Dashboard.test.tsx` and cover:
- Component rendering
- User interactions
- State management
- Form validation

Manual testing should be performed for visual aspects and integration with the backend.
